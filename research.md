## Effect Modification by Acute Change in a Biomarker:
- Utilized the principal stratification framework with a normal copula model, governed by the correlation between potential biomarker changes under treatment and placebo, to estimate conditional average treatment effects
- I explore the impact of acute biomarker changes on treatment effect on long-term clinical endpoints in randomized clinical trials.
- Address the challenge of analyzing treatment-biomarker interactions in the presence of post-randomization factors and situations where the conventional monotonicity assumption may oversimplify the complex biological realities faced in clinical settings.

## Estimating Per-Protocol Effects in Emulated Target Trials with Competing Risks:
- Methods for estimating per-protocol effects in time-to-event studies with competing risks by using the discrete-time counterfactual sub-distribution functions.
- Employed inverse probability weighting to address time-varying confounding, competing risks, adherence, and loss to follow-up.
- I apply this method to an emulated target trial investigating the effects of angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), probable dementia (PD), and all-cause mortality.

## Estimating the Effect of Hospital-Acquired Infections on Excess Length of Hospital Stay in the Presence of Hospital Mortality:
- Working on methods for estimating the distribution of observed LOS and the LOS that would be observed if all Hospital-Acquired Infections could be prevented.
- This method will address potential time-varying confounding and the competing event of hospital mortality.
